This article concerns the debate regarding *tabs vs. spaces*.  
While I personally use ***tabs***, I was surprised to learn those who use **spaces** receive a larger salary than those who use **tabs**.  It was shown that across several countries that the majority of those who use **spaces** actually earn more, regardless of external factors such as firm, experience, or education.  

However, I will forever use *tabs*.
